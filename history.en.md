Left arrow focuses to the parent tab or collapses the tree.

   * Fixed: Linux specific style rules were not loaded unexpectedly.
   * Fixed: On Linux + GNOME3, "narrow scroll bar" was not narrow.

 - 0.12.2011120101
   * Improved: While you are browsing tabs by Ctrl-Tab/Ctrl-Shift-Tab, now collapsed tree is automatically expanded, if you stay there with pressed Ctrl key.

   * Improved: Title of "dummy" tabs can be changed by F2 key.
   * Improved: Tooltip on a tree now reports only top 10 tabs at first, and it is expanded to scrollable tooltip automatically after a delay. (You can change the delay via a secret preference `extensions.treestyletab.tooltip.fullTooltipDelay`.)

   * Fixed: Dropped tabs were broken if they are dropped on "indent" areas.
   * Fixed: Shrunken vertical tab bar couldn't be resized by drag and drop because the tab bar was unexpectedly expanded anyway.
   * Modified: Tooltip on tree always show tree. If you like the old behavior (tooltip with tree only for collapsed tree), you can set a secret preference `extensions.treestyletab.tooltip.mode` to `1`. (`0` means "never", `2` means "always").
   * Modified: The counter in a parent tab now reports the number of all tabs in the tree including itself.
 - 0.12.2011110101
   * Fixed: "Open in tabs" feature for bookmark folder didn't work. (regression on 0.12.2011102901)
