Tree Style Tab bare minimum working version for Pale Moon

This is a fork of YUKI "Piro" Hiroshi's indispensable Tree Style Tabs addon for Firefox, which unfortunately stopped working in Pale Moon. 

## Maintenance

I'm happy to accept pull requests but I will only be personally fixing bugs that impact my use of the addon.
